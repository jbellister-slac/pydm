Migration Guide
===============

Not often we break code at PyDM but sometimes we gotta break the eggs to make
a tasteful omelette.

In this section we will try to minimize the pain to migrate to newer versions
of the code when we do break an existing API.


Changes from PyDM 1.x to 2.x
============================

PyDM 2.x introduces the concept of structured data which drove a major refactor
at the Data Plugins. Part of this refactor allow developers to create new data
plugins with fewer lines of code since most of the administrative tasks are
handled by the base classes now.

Also, now the Data Plugins will be able to hint to widgets where to find the
data for key components such as ``value``, ``connection status``, ``write access status``,
and others, by providing an introspection dictionary which points the widgets
for keys in the data dictionary that is provided by this data plugin.

Data Plugins
------------

Here are the changes that data plugin developers will need to perform in order
to be compatible with PyDM 2.x or greater:

- Address now can be a dictionary not just the simple address.

    Before the ``address`` parameter to a ``PyDMConnection`` was just a simple
    string with the ``address`` information.
    Now in order to allow for complex data plugins such as HTTP services and
    more, we changed the ``address`` to be a JSON string.
    Here is how data plugin developers must deal with it in order to get the
    information needed:

.. code-block:: python
    def __init__(self, channel, address, protocol=None, parent=None):
        super(Connection, self).__init__(channel, address, protocol, parent)
        conn = parse_channel_config(address, force_dict=True)['connection']
        address = conn.get('parameters', {}).get('address')
- Removal of individual signals for ``connection``, ``value`` and others:

    The multiple signals (``connection_state_signal``, ``new_value_signal``,
    ``new_severity_signal`` and others) are now deprecated in favor of the new :ref: `data_store`.
    Existing Data Plugins must be modified to no longer emit signals but instead add the proper information into the
    ``data`` dictionary.

Example
++++++++

.. code-block:: python
    self.new_value_signal[np.ndarray].emit(value)
    # becomes:
    self.data[DataKeys.VALUE] = value
    # This adds the data to the DataStore and fires the signal to notify the
    # Channel that new data is available.
    self.send_to_channel()
